Here are the answers to the questions in Lab 8:

1. **How many errors appear?**
   - There are two errors in the program.
   - The first error is on line 13, where there should be a semicolon at the end of the declaration `int i, count`.
   - The second error is on line 17, where the `sscanf` function should take the address of `count` as its argument, so it should be `sscanf(Buffer, "%d", &count);`.

2. **How many warnings appear?**
   - There are two warnings in the program.
   - The first warning is related to the `sscanf` function call, which is fixed by addressing the first error.
   - The second warning is due to the for loop on line 19, where the condition `i == 0` should be an assignment `i = 0`, and the loop should not have a semicolon at the end.

3. **What happens when you run the program and enter the value 10?**
   - The program will likely produce unexpected behavior or incorrect output because of the logic errors present in the code.

4. **What value is printed after "The sum of integers 0 to 10 is:"?**
   - The printed value will be incorrect due to the errors in the loop. It is likely to print the value of `count` instead of the actual sum.

5. **What value should have been printed?**
   - The correct value should be 55, which is the sum of integers from 0 to 10.

6. **How many warnings appear without the -Wall option?**
   - Without the `-Wall` option, there might be no warnings displayed.

7. **How many warnings appear with the -Wall option?**
   - With the `-Wall` option, two warnings are likely to appear, as mentioned in question 2.

8. **How many times does the printf statement you added get executed?**
   - The `printf` statement inside the for loop will not get executed due to the semicolon at the end of the for loop declaration.

9. **List in order the numerical values of sum output by the printf statement you added:**
   - No values will be output because the `printf` statement does not get executed.

10. **How many times does the printf statement you added get executed after fixing the loop?**
    - After fixing the loop, the `printf` statement should get executed 10 times.

11. **List in order the numerical values of sum output by the printf statement you added after fixing the loop:**
    - The values of sum will be 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, in order.

12. **What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement after fixing the loop?**
    - The value of sum output by the program should be 55.

13. **Did the "statement with no effect" warning message go away after fixing the loop?**
    - Yes, the warning message should go away after fixing the loop.

14. **How many times does the printf statement you added get executed after addressing the "statement with no effect"?**
    - The `printf` statement should get executed 10 times after addressing the "statement with no effect."

15. **List in order the numerical values of sum output by the printf statement you added after addressing the "statement with no effect":**
    - The values of sum will be the same as in question 11: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45.

16. **What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement after addressing the "statement with no effect"?**
    - The value of sum output by the program should still be 55.

17. **How many times does the printf statement you added get executed after fixing the for loop semicolon issue?**
    - After fixing the semicolon issue, the `printf` statement should get executed 11 times.

18. **List in order the numerical values of sum output by the printf statement you added after fixing the for loop semicolon issue:**
    - The values of sum will be 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55.

19. **What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement after fixing the for loop semicolon issue?**
    - The value of sum output by the program should be 55.

20. **Is the final value of sum correct?**
    - Yes, the final value of sum is correct.

21. **Which integer is missing in the loop execution?**
    - The integer 10 is missing in the loop
