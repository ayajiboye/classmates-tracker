P1 - ClassmatesTracker - This program was written because I had an idea and I was curious to see how to implement it. I am currently taking a data structures class this semester and between that class and some of the others I'm taking, I've been seeing so many familiar faces. I was wondering if there was a way to know all the people who I have two or more classes in common with and that was how this project was born.
P2 - Todo List - Yes, everyone makes a todo list, but I had to do it. It was necessary to show off my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, Java syntax, data structures, user input handling, and error handling.
